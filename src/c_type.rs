//! [`CType<T>`] — the layout newtype for a `*-sys` type — and [`CCell`], the
//! trait linking it to its borrowed handles.
//!
//! # Nothing ever references a wrapped C object
//!
//! That is the one rule this crate is built on; everything else follows. A
//! `&Wrapper` covering a C object's bytes asserts `noalias` / `readonly` /
//! validity over memory C may write through a pointer it kept — so no such
//! reference is ever formed. Access goes through **handles** that hold the
//! pointer by value:
//!
//! | Type | Size | Role |
//! |------|------|------|
//! | `Foo` (= [`CType<ffi::foo>`](CType)) | the C struct's | layout only: embeds by value in a `#[repr(C)]` mirror, and is what [`CBox`](crate::CBox) points at. **Never referenced.** |
//! | `FooRef<'a>` | one pointer | shared borrow; `Copy`; the getters live here |
//! | `FooMut<'a>` | one pointer | exclusive borrow; derefs to `FooRef<'a>`, adds the setters |
//!
//! `&FooRef` covers the *handle* — one pointer of Rust-owned stack — never the
//! C object, so it carries no claim about it. Field access projects a raw
//! pointer out of the handle and reads or writes through `addr_of!` /
//! `addr_of_mut!`, which form no reference either.
//!
//! That is why the handles get `&self` / `&mut self` methods for free, and why
//! passing `&mut FooRef` around reborrows implicitly the way `&mut T` does.
//!
//! # What `CType` still carries
//!
//! Only `PhantomPinned`. Address-sensitivity is **independent** of aliasing: a
//! self-referential struct, or one C recorded in a list, must not move whether
//! or not anyone holds a reference to it. So `CType<T>` is `T` plus `!Unpin`
//! and nothing else — no `UnsafeCell` (no reference to strip attributes from)
//! and no `MaybeUninit` (no reference asserting validity).
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! `#[repr(transparent)]` over `T`, and `PhantomPinned` is a ZST, so
//! `size_of::<CType<T>>() == size_of::<T>()` and likewise for alignment. A
//! generated newtype is transparent over `CType<T>` in turn, so `Foo` embeds by
//! value in a `#[repr(C)]` parent and `Option<CBox<Foo>>` is a niche
//! `*mut ffi::foo`.
//!
//! # Relationship to the macro
//!
//! [`define_ctype!`](crate::define_ctype) emits all three types at once,
//! together with the [`CCell`] impl that links them:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! define_ctype!(SslSession, libssl_sys::ssl_session_st);
//! // -> pub struct SslSession(CType<libssl_sys::ssl_session_st>);
//! //    pub struct SslSessionRef<'a>(..);   // getters
//! //    pub struct SslSessionMut<'a>(..);   // + setters
//! //    unsafe impl CCell for SslSession { type C = ..; type Ref<'a> = ..; type Mut<'a> = ..; }
//! ```
