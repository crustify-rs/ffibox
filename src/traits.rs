//! Lifecycle and ownership trait **contracts** — the vocabulary that says what
//! teardown / clone means for a wrapped C type. The owning smart pointers in
//! [`owned_refs`](crate::owned_refs) consume these as bounds; the `impl_*!`
//! macros in [`macros`](crate::macros) implement them.
//!
//! The two base traits form a drop/clone pair, the clone trait a sub-trait of
//! the drop trait (a cloned handle owes the same teardown):
//!
//! | Trait        | Registers                               | Enables            |
//! |--------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|
//! | [`CDropped`] | `c_drop` — a `*_free` **or** a down-ref  | `CBox`, `CVoidBox` |
//! | [`CCloned`]  | `c_clone` — a `*_dup` **or** an `up_ref` | `Clone for CBox`   |
//!
//! There is no separate "shared" column: exclusive and refcounted ownership
//! differ only in *which C routine* you register, not in the handle type. See
//! [`CCloned`] for the two mechanisms it spans.
//!
//! Alongside: [`CValued`] (by-value dispose), [`CLenDropped`] / [`CLenCloned`]
//! (length-aware buffer strategies), and the `*With` strategy traits
//! [`CDropper`] / [`CCloner`] — which also carry the construction phase, a
//! storage-only [`CDropper`] holding the allocation until
//! [`CBoxWith::into_box`] promotes it. [`Owner`] is the odd one out: no
//! teardown of its own, just the promise to keep someone else's object alive
//! for a [`CTethered`](crate::CTethered) child.

/// newtype), or the refcount **down-ref** of a shared type. The wrapper does
/// not distinguish them.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - `c_drop` must free the object and every sub-resource it owns.

///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Conditional teardown
///
/// A destructor that must be suppressed on some paths folds the gate **into
/// `c_drop`** — read the object's own state and return early. For scope-driven
/// dismissal that is not a property of the object, defuse via

///
/// | C pattern                              | `c_clone` does                     | Returns          |
/// |----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------|
/// | `*_dup` deep-copies (`EVP_PKEY_dup`)   | allocate a fresh object            | the **new** ptr  |
/// | `*_up_ref` bumps a counter in place    | increment the refcount             | the **same** ptr |
///
/// Which applies is a property of the C API, not the Rust handle: both yield a
/// second `CBox<T>` that must be dropped, and `c_drop` settles the debt either
/// way. [`impl_cloned!`](crate::impl_cloned) takes the mechanism as a named
/// argument (`dup = …` / `up_ref = …`) because the C signatures differ — a
/// dup's return value *is* the new handle, an `up_ref`'s is a status and the
/// handle to keep is the original.
///
/// Sub-trait of [`CDropped`]: every clone owes the same teardown.
///
/// **A type exposing both: the `up_ref` wins.** Register the bump as `c_clone`
/// and leave the deep copy as an inherent method. On a refcounted type `Clone`
/// means "another handle to the same object" — what the C API and callers
/// expect; a silently deep-copying `Clone` would break identity comparisons and
/// double the allocation cost.
///

///
/// - A `Some` return must owe **exactly one** `c_drop` beyond the one `obj`
///   already owes: a fresh fully-initialised allocation for a deep copy, an
